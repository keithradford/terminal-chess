# Terminal Chess

The game of chess using much of the logic from one of my first programming projects, [Java Console Snake](https://github.com/keithradford/Java-Console-Snake). 

As mentioned, Java Console Snake was one of my first projects after learning how to code, thus the project itself is quite messy. The goal of this project is to capture the idea of making a game with Java played through the terminal, but with a more feasible game, chess.
